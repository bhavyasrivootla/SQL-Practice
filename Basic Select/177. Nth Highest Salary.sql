/*
Write a solution to find the nth highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there are less than n distinct salaries, return null.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output: 
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
*/

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    set N = N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
    select distinct salary 
    from Employee
    order by salary desc
    limit 1 offset N
  );
END
